1. Be sure to include 'gunicorn' in the requirements.txt

2.0 To deploy, first make sure to have heroku-cli isntalled: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli
2.1 Make sure to have a remote called 'heroku': 'heroku git:remote -a restaurant-seat-finder-api'
2.2 When heroku-cli is installed and the remote is available, run 'git push heroku master'. 
	This pushes your version of your current branch to the master branch in heroku, 
	from there, heroku should automatically rebuild and deploy the app (this might take a minute)
